              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                All our seed has been planted, grown, cut and processed by the
                Shirley Family. We have been in the Reg/Cert Seed Business since
                1975. The foundation that the business was built on actually
                began with an FFA project for Joe during his sophomore year in
                high school, when his Ag teacher encouraged him to plant a new
                variety of wheat at that time, it was TASCOSA. In 1972, Joe
                married his wife Ann, a farm girl from Kay County and together
                they worked to build the family farm. The first farm was
                purchased and later had the opportunity to purchase additional
                land from the Grandfather's estate. Like most farms in western
                Oklahoma, farming was not without rials, disappointments, and
                hardships. Throughout the years, the family has endured complete
                crop failures due to the devastating hail storms back-to-back in
                1980 and 1981.
